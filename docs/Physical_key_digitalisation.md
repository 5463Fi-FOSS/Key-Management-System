# What is with physical keys ?

differently from transpoder e.g. DOM Transpoder or any other Digital Locks with NFC Tags, physical Keys has mostly no unique identifier. 

## decision
#### Unique Identifier

#### Pictures

In a office enviroment there is often a Printer with a flatbed scanner. So the first idea was it to use it, with a scale beside the key.

**My 1. Test:**

**learning:** a Scanner from a Printer is not suitable for this us case. 

**Next Idea:** my best idea was it to use a Smartphone camera. On a smartphoen holder for e.g. 35mm film scanner and a Scale and in best case also graph/milimeter paper.

=> Much more better Quality only light/scale/position must be improved
